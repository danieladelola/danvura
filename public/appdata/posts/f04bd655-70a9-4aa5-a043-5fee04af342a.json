It is a sales tool.<br data-start=\"97\" data-end=\"100\">When done well, it brings daily leads and steady cash flow.</p>\n<p data-start=\"161\" data-end=\"268\">Most brands post at random. They chase trends. They copy big pages.<br data-start=\"228\" data-end=\"231\">That path leads to noise, not growth.</p>\n<p data-start=\"270\" data-end=\"394\">Start with one clear goal. Do you want calls, chats, or site visits?<br data-start=\"338\" data-end=\"341\">Pick one goal per week. Track it with simple numbers.</p>\n<p data-start=\"396\" data-end=\"512\">Know your buyer well. What problem keeps them awake at night?<br data-start=\"457\" data-end=\"460\">Speak to that pain in plain words. Skip fancy lines.</p>\n<p data-start=\"514\" data-end=\"626\">Post stories, not ads. Share short wins from past buyers.<br data-start=\"571\" data-end=\"574\">Show before and after shots. Keep it real and brief.</p>\n<p data-start=\"628\" data-end=\"736\">Use video often. A phone clip beats a clean photo.<br data-start=\"678\" data-end=\"681\">Talk like you talk to friends. People trust real faces.</p>\n<p data-start=\"738\" data-end=\"833\">Reply to every comment. Send quick DMs after replies.<br data-start=\"791\" data-end=\"794\">Most sales come from these small chats.</p>\n<p data-start=\"835\" data-end=\"906\">Post three times each week. Keep the days fixed.<br data-start=\"883\" data-end=\"886\">People love routine.</p>\n<p data-start=\"908\" data-end=\"987\">End each post with one clear action.<br data-start=\"944\" data-end=\"947\">Tell them to send a DM. Or tap the link.</p>\n<p data-start=\"989\" data-end=\"1100\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Social media rewards focus. Pick one goal. Serve one group.<br data-start=\"1048\" data-end=\"1051\">Do this for sixty days. You will see real change.</p>",
